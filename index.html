    <h1>Welcome to my CUS 1172 page!</h1>
    <h2>My name is Sidney Lord!</h2>

    <p>I am a Senior here at St. Johns, having spent all four of my years focused in on the idea</p>
    <p>of getting my degree in computer science. I'm excited to break out into the working world</p>
    <p>and show off what I can do with or in comparison to my peers!</p>

<h1>Education</h1>
<p>I started my education back at P.S. 132, and ever since my first class with them back in the third grade, I had always found computers to be facinating to work with. Ever since first learning how to correctly type and create things such as art and comics on the computer, I would push myself further in both middle school and high school to get better at working with them. By the 6th grade, I was coding with html, and even a bit of python. In high school I learned how to create entire websites with html, css, and javascript, and thanks to all of that, I knew that I'd want to focus on becoming a computer science major when I got to St. John's University, which I have worked to become for the last 3 and a half years, and i'm ready to go up and accept my diploma!</p>

<h1>Work Experience</h1>
<p>I sadly have yet to get a real job out in the field yet (though trust me I have tried my best so far, 100 applications and counting.) But that doesn't mean I have nothing to show for work experience!</p> 
<ul>
<li>I have done a few public beta tests for unrelleased products.</li> 
<li>I helped out in offices with work for family matters. </li>
<li>I've worked on plenty of different java programs, some simple and some more diverse. </li>
<li>I'm most proud of one done with a group of three other coders, where we created an entire interface, both front-end an back-end for a job owner database, listing employees andd vehicles and being able to view and edit them on the fly.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Programming Skills</h1>
<p>Over the years i've used quite a few different coding languages, here's the notable ones:</p>
<table>
<tr>
    <th>Programming Language</th>
    <th>Experience</th>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>HTML</td>
    <td>I have plenty of familiarity, I have been working with this for many years</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>CSS</td>
    <td>Very familiar with this for the same reason as HTML</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Javascript</td>
    <td>Not quite as familiar but I do have experience with it</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Java</td>
    <td>Very Familiar, It's been what i've been working with for all of college</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>MySQL</td>
    <td>I hace decent experience with this from one class, but I could probably know more</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Python</td>
    <td>Can definately learn more about this language, I worked with it lightly in an afterschool program</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>XML</td>
    <td>Hardly familiar with this, I used this for a bit when creating a mod for a game I was a fan of</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h1>General Interests</h1>
<p>I have plenty of hobbies! For one I quite enjoy writing, finding it to be a good way to get my thoughts and ideas out for either myself or others to enjoy. I'm also fairly big into video games, though it'd be hard to say what specific genres I enjoy, as I continue expanding my horizons with them. (However recently I'd say i've been enjoying games such as the Sam and Max series, Deadlock, and UFO50.) I'm also a big fan of drawing and art, wether it be just pencil doodles or digital art pieces, the picture shown up at the top of the page was one I created myself! This piece here was a recent one that I really enjoyed making:</p>

<h1>Favorite Media</h1>
<p>It's always been hard for me to pick favorites, maybe I just like too many things... Or i'm just indecisive. But heres what i'll consider my favorite song, movie and tv show:</p>
<h2>Get Lucky - Daft Punk</h2>
<p>It's kinda strange that I think of this one as a classic now, I remember listening to it back in 2013, and yeah it's still just as catchy as it was back then.</p>

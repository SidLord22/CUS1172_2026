        <h1><span id="Edu">Education</span></h1>
        <p>I started my education back at P.S. 132, and ever since my first class with them back in the third grade, I had always found computers to be facinating to work with. Ever since first learning how to correctly type and create things such as art and comics on the computer, I would push myself further in both middle school and high school to get better at working with them. By the 6th grade, I was coding with html, and even a bit of python. In high school I learned how to create entire websites with html, css, and javascript, and thanks to all of that, I knew that I'd want to focus on becoming a computer science major when I got to St. John's University, which I have worked to become for the last 3 and a half years, and i'm ready to go up and accept my diploma!</p>

        <p>I sadly have yet to get a real job out in the field yet (though trust me I have tried my best so far, 100 applications and counting.) But that doesn't mean I have nothing to show for work experience!</p>

        <p>I have plenty of hobbies! For one I quite enjoy writing, finding it to be a good way to get my thoughts and ideas out for either myself or others to enjoy. I'm also fairly big into video games, though it'd be hard to say what specific genres I enjoy, as I continue expanding my horizons with them. (However recently I'd say i've been enjoying games such as the Sam and Max series, Deadlock, and UFO50.) I'm also a big fan of drawing and art, wether it be just pencil doodles or digital art pieces, the picture shown up at the top of the page was one I created myself! This piece here was a recent one that I really enjoyed making:</p>

        <h1 style="text-decoration: underline;">Favorite Websites</h1>
        <p>Now the way I see it, theres two ways to look at for deciding what favorite website is, either it's the website that you use the most, or the website that you like the most. For the route of websites that I use the most, I feel like some obvious answers would be youtube or twitter, but honestly that's pretty boring, since most, if not all people have used those sites before. But for the sites I like the most, I'd have to go with some more personalized sites like wikis. Theres the <a href="http://www.hrwiki.org/">Homestar Runner Wiki</a>, which is so in-depth about this strange, all over the place flash cartoon that it's pretty impressive. Another one of my favorites would be the <a href="https://spongebob.fandom.com/wiki/Encyclopedia_SpongeBobia">Spongebob Wiki</a>, which I find enjoyable to just go on and search for random things. If you went on there right now and searched whatever random object or thing popped into your head, I bet for sure there'd be an entire page written up by some random guy all about how it's used in Spongebob somehow.</p>
